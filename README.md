# PQQ
This repository contains the code and associated files for the research paper **"Deep Learning-Driven Discovery of PQQ as a Neuroprotective Compound in Alzheimer's Disease"**.

## Project Overview
In this research, we employed deep learning techniques to screen a series of compounds for their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties. Through this approach, we identified PQQ as a promising compound for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) treatment. The primary focus of the paper is to elucidate the mechanism of action of PQQ in AD.
